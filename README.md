# Couette
Fluid Mechanics Spring 2022 
This report is composed of multiple documents. 
The PDF file is the project report

The two .csv files contain the data and errors respectively

the .ipynb file contains the code used to generate the .csv files and the figures used in the report

This file can be run using Jupyter notebook, as part of the Anaconda software package.

It is a python notebook file, and can all be executed from the "Restart and Run All" button in the "Kernel" tab that is visible when the notebook is opened

The varaibles that can most easily be changed are the values in the N and dt arrays, and the err value in the first block of code.  These will have an effect on the figures generated.  

In order to change the input values for the generation of the .csv file, the "choice_N" and "choice_dt" variables need to be changed.
